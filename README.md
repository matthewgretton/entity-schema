# entity-schema

Small example app to demonstrate storing entity schema data in a database, and using that information for validation purposes. Also demonstrates how versioning can be easliy implemented to ensure validation is consistent historically.

# Usage

Schema Example:

```clojure
{:db/ident                  :entity.schema/customer
 :entity.schema/fields      #{{:field/schema    :customer/name}
                               :field/nullable? false}

                              {:field/schema             :customer/age}
                               :field/nullable?          true}}
 :entity.schema/natural-key [:customer/name]}

{:db/ident                  :entity.schema/order
 :entity.schema/fields      #{{:field/schema    :order/item-name}
                               :field/nullable? false}

                              {:field/schema             :order/customer}
                               :field/entity-schema      :entity.schema/customer
                               :field/nullable?          false}}
 :entity.schema/natural-key [:order/customer order/item-name]}
```

Entity Example

```clojure
{:test-entity/ref-field {:entity2/double-field 10.0}
 :test-entity/string-field     "Bob"}
```

# Installation

To pull down Datomic dependencies you need to read from a private repository. This requires authentication credentials. 

You will need [gpg installed](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/doc/GPG.md#installing-gpg) and a [key pair configured](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/doc/GPG.md#creating-a-keypair). 

Add the below to your credentials.clj map as described in the following [gpg guide](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/DEPLOY.md#gpg).


`{#"my\.datomic\.com" {:username "matthew.gretton@gmail.com" :password "e76febfa-e7aa-4520-8fe8-b8508fd62f09"}}`


Once you've done that, you should be able run

`lein deps`

to ensure you download dependencies.


When using Datomic the symbols arenâ€™t resolved in the editor or the REPL due to the fact that Datomic is distributed
without source code. To work around the issue do the following:

- Download https://cursive-ide.com/datomic-stubs-0.9.5153.jar
- Install that jar to your local repository cache using mvn install:install-file -Dfile=datomic-stubs-0.9.5153.jar -DartifactId=datomic-stubs -Dversion=0.9.5153 -DgroupId=cursive -Dpackaging=jar
- Add these stubs to your project: [cursive/datomic-stubs "0.9.5153" :scope "provided"]
